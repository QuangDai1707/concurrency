## Feature Engineering Examples
```
# Logon anomaly detection
logon_hour_deviation = |current_logon_hour - avg_logon_hour|
after_hours_flag = logon_hour < 8 OR logon_hour > 18

# Access pattern analysis  
unique_resources_ratio = unique_shares_today / avg_unique_shares
access_volume_spike = today_file_access > (avg_access * 3)

# Privilege escalation indicators
admin_events_increase = admin_actions_today > historical_avg * 2
new_privilege_use = first_time_special_privilege == TRUE
```
